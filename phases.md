# Setup
This is the first phase of problem solving. It is important to make sure you understand the problem, plan your approach, and analyze the quality of your approach.
## Parse
Here you should make sure that you have a clear understanding of inputs, outputs, constraints and a good name in verbNoun format. You want to make sure you know what data structure to use, what the structure looks like in code and a sample of data to use for testing.
## Strategize
Now is the time to come up with a plan of attack. Don't focus on coming up with the most eloquent solution at first. Create a high level plan for what procedures you will need to get from input to output. Once the high level plan makes sense, go deeper creating a step by step strategy using precise english. Once the pseudocode is complete spend time to analyze the big-o to get an idea of the quality of the solution. Think of ways to refactor into a better complexity (space or time). Adjust your high level and step by step strategies to match the revised solution.
